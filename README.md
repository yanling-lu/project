# project

This project repo serves a number of purposes: 
* The project repo is meant to show proper project structure and file/folder naming conventions. The files are organized and named based on best practices highlighted in Module 6. 
* The project also guided us through creating a virtual environment export file titled "environment.yaml" that is meant to hold the environment specifications to run the Reports JuypterLab notebook.
* The files provided includes scripts and data that would allow a user to generate a report that has the results of training a model based on machine learning.
